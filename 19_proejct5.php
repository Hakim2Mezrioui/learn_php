/*
*PROBLEM:
*we want to write a function calculate the distance between two place with their latitude and longitude
*Steps to calculate the distance
* 1- calculate the difference of longitude of the second place and the first place
* 2- we need to convert this value to radians
* 3- and then calculate its cosine
* 4- convert the latitude of both places to radians
* 5- calculate the sine and cosine of both converted latitudes
* 6- sine of converted latitudes muliplied plus cosines multiplied
